In the presentation I mainly focused on design and the logic rather than on describing the development steps. I also faced several issues and it affected the size and the content of presentation:

1. Page rank algorithm. There are a lot of descriptions of page rank algorithm in the Internet and they all a little bit different. I have chose the one from Wikipedia. All descriptions only describe first iteration - 
   calculation based on initial ranks of pages. I tried to makes second iteration using new calculated ranks and I saw the results were enough far from what they should really be, so I did not include further iterations 
   in the presentation. For example, if page A has a rank of 0.625 (it has a lot of links to it from other pages) and it also has one outbound  link to page B then according to the algorithms in the Internet it should transfer 
   its rank (0.625) to page B and B's rank would be PR(B) + PR(A) - that means it finally would be greater than A's page rank but it contradicts with main concepts of page rank theory (PR(B) can't be  greater than PR(A) because 
   it only has one link from PR(A)).

2. Wiki JSON data dump. I downloaded the file and learned it's structure. It does not contain the topology I need for the test. I couldn't find any outbound links to other pages. I searched the Internet and found that articles 
   themselves are stored in XML files (not JSON). I did not have time to download and check those files so in the presentations I assumed that JSON dump contains all necessary content and "worked" with it.
