Hi.

 Please find designed DWH schema in the following diagrams:
  - Dimension tables - contains all dimension tables;
  - Fact tables - contains all fact tables;
  - Common - contains all tables and relationships between them;
  - ORDER - describes F_ORDER table;
  - SHIPMRNT - describes F_SHIPMENT table;
  - RETURN - describes F_RETURN table.

 Dimenstions are divided into two types:
  - Static dimenstions - L_ORDER_STATUS, L_DATE, L_RETURN_REASON, L_ADMIN - the data in these tables is static and added manually when needed.
  - Dynamic dimenstions - L_USER, L_PRODUCT, L_VARIANT,  - the data is loaded by ETL processes. All these dimensions are SCD2 type dimensions. They have 
    EFFECTINE_START_DATE and EFFECTIVE_END_DATE and also CURRENT_FLAG. I thought that product and customer data is important and hence worth to have a history.
    Current record for such tables contains CURRENT_FLAG='Y' and EFFECTIVE_END_DATE='12/31/9999'. 
     
 Each fact table contains set of fields which is common for all fact tables: 
  - surrogate key (with the suffix "_KEY");
  - ETL_LOAD_DATE (time when record was created in the table); 
  - unique key (ID) from source table for back tracking;
  - DAY_ID (reference to L_DATE table). The source value is a truncated "update_date_time" value from corresponding source table;
  - Transaction date - "update_date_time" value from corresponding source table (not truncated).  
 Other fields were transferred as is. 
 
 Below you can find descriptions of main tables:
 
 F_ORDER table:
  - ORDER_KEY - surrogate key;
  - ID - id from source;

  - USER_KEY - reference to L_USER table;
  - ORDER_TIME - "update_date_time" from source table;
  - CHARGE_AMOUNT - as is;
  - TAX_AMOUNT - as is;
  - COUPON_AMOUNT - as is;
  - ETL_LOAD_DATE - when record was created.
  
 F_SHIPMENT table:
  - SHIPMENT_KEY - surrogate key;
  - ID - id from source;
  - ORDER_KEY - reference to F_ORDER.ORDER_KEY;
  - DAY_KEY - reference to L_DATE table. Source value: trunc("update_date_time") from source table;
  - SHIPMENT_TIME - "update_date_time" from source table;
  - START_DAY_KEY - reference to L_DATE;
  - FINISH_DAY_KEY - reference to L_DATE;
  - NUM_PACKAGES - as is;

  - DAY_KEY - reference to L_DATE table. Source value: trunc("update_date_time") from source table;
  - RETURN_TIME - "update_date_time" from source table;

  - VARIANT_KEY - reference to L_VARIANT table;
  - ORDER_KEY - reference to F_ORDER table;
  - SALE_PRICE - as is;
  - QUANTITY_ORDERED - as is;
  - QUANTITY_OVERSOLD - as is;
  - ITEM_TIME - "update_date_time" from source table;
  - ETL_LOAD_DATE - when record was created.
  
 L_USER table:
  - USER_KEY - surrogate key;
  - ID - id from source;
  - USER_FIRST_NAME - as is;
  - USER_LAST_NAME - as is;
  - VIP_FLAG -  possible values - Y/N;
  - ADDRESS - as is;
  - LAST_PURCHASE - as is;
  - EFFECTIVE_START_DATE - time when the record became effective;
  - EFFECTIVE_END_DATE DATE - time when the record was closed. '12/31/2016' for current record;
  - CURRENT_FLAG - indicates current record, possible values - Y/N;
  - ETL_LOAD_DATE - when record was created.
  
 L_PRODUCT table:
  - PRODUCT_KEY - surrogate key;
  - ID - id from source;

  - MSRP - as is;
  - EFFECTIVE_START_DATE - time when the record became effective;
  - EFFECTIVE_END_DATE DATE - time when the record was closed. '12/31/2016' for current record;
  - CURRENT_FLAG - indicates current record, possible values - Y/N;
  - ETL_LOAD_DATE - when record was created.
  
 I also created DDLs (for Oracle DB) for all tables. You can find them in ddl_oracle.sql
 Scripts that calculate sample metrics are located in sql_scripts_oracle.sql.
 I used MySQL Workbench to create diagrams, so I also attached the diagram file - DWH diagram.mwb
